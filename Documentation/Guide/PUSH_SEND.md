## Payload handling

Exponea will automatically handle interactions you've provided in **Payload Builder**
You need only to provide valid URL for browser interaction and a URI for **Deep link** like so:

### Deep link Handling

Exponea SDK notifications can handle the deeplink automatically, however if you wish to be notified of user's actions, then you need to implement a `PushNotificationsDelegate` in your application.

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
	func application(_ application: UIApplication,
	                     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
	     // Auth Exponea
        Exponea.shared.configure(plistName: "Exponea.plist")
        
        // Set notification delegate (needs to be done after configuring)
        Exponea.shared.pushNotificationsDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate
	}
}

extension AppDelegate: PushNotificationManagerDelegate {
    func pushNotificationOpened(with action: ExponeaNotificationActionType, 
                                value: String?, 
                                extraData: [AnyHashable : Any]?) {
        print("Action \(action), value: \(String(describing: value)), extraData \(String(describing: extraData)")
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**  
> You can only set the `pushNotificationsDelegate` after you have configured Exponea, never before.
